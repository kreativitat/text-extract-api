IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CLASS:

This is not the final version of the object, namespace, or intended use. 

For this reason, I am not creating an interface, etc. Add code here as soon as possible 
along with further integrations, and once we have gained sufficient experience, we will 
undertake a refactor.

Currently, the object's purpose is to replace the use of a primitive type, a string, for 
extract returns. The limitation of this approach became evident when returning only the 
resulting string caused us to lose valuable metadata about the document. Thanks to this 
class, we retain DoclingDocument and foresee that other converters/OCRs may have similar 
metadata.
